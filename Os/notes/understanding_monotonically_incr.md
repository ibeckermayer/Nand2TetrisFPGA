What does monotonically increasing mean?

---

**Cursor**

"Monotonically increasing" means that a function never decreases as its input increases. In other words, for a function f(x), if x₁ < x₂, then f(x₁) ≤ f(x₂).

In the context of the square root function y = √x:
- As x gets larger, √x also gets larger (or stays the same)
- The function never "goes down" - it only goes up or stays flat
- For example: √1 = 1, √4 = 2, √9 = 3, √16 = 4, etc.

This property is crucial for the binary search algorithm used to compute square roots because:

1. **Predictable behavior**: If we're looking for √x and we try a guess y where y² > x, we know the answer must be smaller than y
2. **Binary search works**: We can systematically narrow down the search range because the monotonic property guarantees that if y² is too big, then any larger value will also be too big
3. **No local minima/maxima**: There are no "bumps" or "valleys" in the function that could confuse a search algorithm

The algorithm in the image exploits this by performing a binary search in the range 0 to 2^(n/2) - 1, systematically checking if (y + 2^j)² ≤ x to build up the square root bit by bit.

Ok... now what's "n" in that explanation? The algorithm relies on n but it's unclear how I initialize it and/or how it evolves

```plaintext
sqrt(x):
// Compute the integer part of y = √x. Strategy:
// Find an integer y such that y² ≤ x < (y + 1)² (for 0 ≤ x < 2^n)
// By performing a binary search in the range 0...2^(n/2) - 1.
y = 0
for j = n/2 - 1...0 do
    if (y + 2^j)² ≤ x then y = y + 2^j
return y
```

```plaintext
static int n;             // Number of bits used for representing a two's complement integer
```

```plaintext
let n = 16;
```

Looking at the Math.jack file you have open, I can see that `n` is defined and initialized in the class:

```jack
static int n;             // Number of bits used for representing a two's complement integer

// In the init() function:
let n = 16;
```

So `n = 16` represents the number of bits used for integers in the Hack computer system (16-bit two's complement integers).

Here's how `n` works in the square root algorithm:

1. **Why n/2?** If you have an n-bit integer x, then √x will require at most n/2 bits to represent. This is because:
   - Maximum n-bit value: 2^n - 1  
   - Square root of that: √(2^n - 1) ≈ 2^(n/2)
   - So √x fits in n/2 bits

2. **The loop variable j**: The algorithm does `for j = n/2 - 1...0 do`
   - For n=16: j goes from 7 down to 0
   - This means we're building the result bit by bit, from most significant bit (bit 7) to least significant bit (bit 0)

3. **The search strategy**: At each step, we test if adding 2^j to our current guess y would still give us a valid square root:
   - We check if `(y + 2^j)² ≤ x`
   - If yes, we set the j-th bit of our result: `y = y + 2^j`
   - If no, we leave that bit as 0 and continue

So `n` is essentially a constant (16) that determines the bit-width of your number system, and the algorithm uses n/2 to determine how many bits the square root result will need.

let n = 16;

You say that √(2^n - 1) ≈ 2^(n/2) , which suggests that the answer might be 2^(n/2), but the algorithm they give puts the upper limit at (2^(n/2) - 1), what explains that?

---

**Cursor**

Great observation! You're right to question that. Let me clarify the precision here:

The key insight is about **bit constraints**, not just approximations.

Here's the exact reasoning:

1. **Input constraint**: For n-bit integers, x can be at most 2^n - 1

2. **Output constraint**: The square root result must also fit in the available bit representation. Since we're finding √x where x uses n bits, the result √x will use at most n/2 bits.

3. **Maximum possible result**: The largest value that can be represented in n/2 bits is exactly **2^(n/2) - 1**

So the algorithm searches in the range [0, 2^(n/2) - 1] because:
- Any result larger than 2^(n/2) - 1 cannot be represented in n/2 bits
- This is a hard constraint, not an approximation

**Example with n=16:**
- Input integers: 0 to 65,535 (2^16 - 1)
- Square root results: 0 to 255 (2^8 - 1)
- Even √65535 ≈ 255.99, which rounds down to 255

The algorithm is being mathematically precise: it searches the exact range of all possible integer results, which is [0, 2^(n/2) - 1]. The upper bound isn't an approximation—it's the mathematical ceiling imposed by the bit representation constraints.

This is why the pseudocode says "binary search in the range 0...2^(n/2) - 1" rather than using any approximation.

Is this algorithm on the right track of what the suggested algorithm suggests to do? Namely, are the starting values correct, and should I be subtracting 1 from j after each iteration?

Yes, your algorithm implementation is on the right track! Let me verify your approach:

**Starting values are correct:**
- `y = 0` ✓
- `j = n/2 - 1 = 16/2 - 1 = 7` ✓

**Loop progression is correct:**
- Yes, you should subtract 1 from `j` after each iteration ✓
- The loop goes from `j = 7` down to `j = 0` (8 total iterations)

**Your calculations look right so far:**
- Iteration 1: `(0 + 128)² = 16384 > 16` → `y` stays 0
- Iteration 2: `(0 + 64)² = 4096 > 16` → `y` stays 0  
- Iteration 3: `(0 + 32)² = 1024 > 16` → `y` stays 0

Let me continue your example to show where it gets interesting:

```
Fourth iteration:
j = 4, testing (0 + 2^4)² = 16² = 256 > 16 → y stays 0

Fifth iteration: 
j = 3, testing (0 + 2^3)² = 8² = 64 > 16 → y stays 0

Sixth iteration:
j = 2, testing (0 + 2^2)² = 4² = 16 ≤ 16 → y = 0 + 4 = 4

Seventh iteration:
j = 1, testing (4 + 2^1)² = 6² = 36 > 16 → y stays 4

Eighth iteration:
j = 0, testing (4 + 2^0)² = 5² = 25 > 16 → y stays 4

Final result: y = 4, which is √16 = 4 ✓
```

Your implementation is correct! You're building up the binary representation of the square root bit by bit, from most significant to least significant bit.

Help me understand / reconcile these two comments about the sqrt function here

---

**Cursor**

```plaintext
function int sqrt(int x) {
    var int y, j, temp;
    let y = 0;
    let j = n/2 - 1;
    while (j > 0) {
        let temp = y + powersOfTwo[j];
        if ((temp * temp) < x) {
        }
        y = y - 1
    }
}
```

Looking at both pieces of information, I can help you reconcile them:

## The Basic Algorithm (Figure 12.3)
The original algorithm is straightforward:
```
if (y + 2^j)² ≤ x then y = y + 2^j
```

## The Overflow Problem
The issue is that when computing `(y + 2^j)²`, this calculation can **overflow** in a 16-bit system. When overflow occurs, the result wraps around and becomes negative, which would make the comparison `(y + 2^j)² ≤ x` incorrectly evaluate to true (since a negative number is less than a positive x).

## The Solution
The modified condition handles overflow by adding a second check:
```
if ((y + 2^j)² ≤ x) and ((y + 2^j)² > 0) then y = y + 2^j
```

The `> 0` check ensures that if overflow occurred (making the result negative), we don't incorrectly add 2^j to y.

## Fixing Your Code
Your current implementation has several issues. Here's the corrected version:

```jack
function int sqrt(int x) {
    var int y, j, temp, tempSquared;
    let y = 0;
    let j = (n/2) - 1;
    while (j > -1) {  // Changed from j > 0 to j > -1 to include j=0
        let temp = y + powersOfTwo[j];
        let tempSquared = temp * temp;
        if ((tempSquared < x) | (tempSquared = x)) {  // ≤ in Jack
            if (tempSquared > 0) {  // Overflow check
                let y = temp;
            }
        }
        let j = j - 1;
    }
    return y;
}
```

The key fixes:
1. **Loop condition**: `j > -1` instead of `j > 0` (to include j=0)
2. **Complete if logic**: Actually update y when condition is met
3. **Overflow protection**: Check that `tempSquared > 0`
4. **Return statement**: Actually return the result

```plaintext
if (y + 2^j)² ≤ x then y = y + 2^j
```

```plaintext
if ((y + 2^j)² ≤ x) and ((y + 2^j)² > 0) then y = y + 2^j
```

```plaintext
function int sqrt(int x) {
    var int y, j, temp, tempSquared;
    let y = 0;
    let j = (n/2) - 1;
    while (j > -1) {  // Changed from j > 0 to j > -1 to include j=0
        let temp = y + powersOfTwo[j];
        let tempSquared = temp * temp;
        if ((tempSquared < x) | (tempSquared = x)) {  // ≤ in Jack
            if (tempSquared > 0) {  // Overflow check
                let y = temp;
            }
        }
        let j = j - 1;
    }
    return y;
}
```

**User**

What makes this "binary search"?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! This is "binary search" in a clever, non-traditional sense. Let me explain:

## Traditional Binary Search vs. This Algorithm

**Traditional binary search:**
- You have a sorted array [0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 255]
- You pick the middle element and compare
- You eliminate half the search space each time

**This sqrt algorithm:**
- You have the same search space [0, 1, 2, ..., 255] 
- But instead of testing middle values, you're **building the answer bit by bit**
- You're making binary decisions about each bit position

## How It's Binary Search

The algorithm searches the space [0, 2^(n/2) - 1] by constructing the binary representation of the answer:

1. **Start with y = 0** (binary: 00000000)
2. **For j = 7**: Test if adding 2^7 = 128 works
   - This asks: "Is the answer ≥ 128?"
   - If yes: y becomes 128 (binary: 10000000)
   - If no: y stays 0 (binary: 00000000)
3. **For j = 6**: Test if adding 2^6 = 64 works
   - This asks: "Is the answer ≥ (current_y + 64)?"
   - This sets or clears the 6th bit
4. **Continue for each bit position...**

## Why It's "Binary" Search

Each iteration makes a **binary decision** about one bit:
- Should bit j be 1 or 0?
- This eliminates exactly half of the remaining possibilities
- After 8 iterations, you've narrowed down from 256 possibilities to 1

## Example: Finding √100
```
j=7: Test (0 + 128)² = 16384 > 100? Yes → bit 7 = 0
j=6: Test (0 + 64)² = 4096 > 100? Yes → bit 6 = 0  
j=5: Test (0 + 32)² = 1024 > 100? Yes → bit 5 = 0
j=4: Test (0 + 16)² = 256 > 100? Yes → bit 4 = 0
j=3: Test (0 + 8)² = 64 ≤ 100? Yes → bit 3 = 1, y = 8
j=2: Test (8 + 4)² = 144 > 100? Yes → bit 2 = 0
j=1: Test (8 + 2)² = 100 ≤ 100? Yes → bit 1 = 1, y = 10
j=0: Test (10 + 1)² = 121 > 100? Yes → bit 0 = 0
```

Result: y = 10 (binary: 00001010)

It's "binary search" because you're systematically determining each bit of the binary representation, eliminating half the search space with each bit decision.

```plaintext
j=7: Test (0 + 128)² = 16384 > 100? Yes → bit 7 = 0
j=6: Test (0 + 64)² = 4096 > 100? Yes → bit 6 = 0  
j=5: Test (0 + 32)² = 1024 > 100? Yes → bit 5 = 0
j=4: Test (0 + 16)² = 256 > 100? Yes → bit 4 = 0
j=3: Test (0 + 8)² = 64 ≤ 100? Yes → bit 3 = 1, y = 8
j=2: Test (8 + 4)² = 144 > 100? Yes → bit 2 = 0
j=1: Test (8 + 2)² = 100 ≤ 100? Yes → bit 1 = 1, y = 10
j=0: Test (10 + 1)² = 121 > 100? Yes → bit 0 = 0
```

**User**

That's interesting... but what's the reasoning behind why that works? I can imagine going down from 128, like 128^2 is > 100, ok so it must be < 128, 64 > 100, ok so it must be < 64 ... 16^2 > 100, ok so it must be < 16, 8^2 is < 100, ok so it must must be between 8 and 16... and then counting up from there (try 9^2, try 10^2, got it!).

But this bit-by-bit mechanism relies on some fundamental principle that I'm missing, help me understand.

---

**Cursor**

Excellent question! You've identified the key insight that makes this algorithm work. The fundamental principle is the **greedy algorithm** combined with **monotonicity**.

## The Core Principle: Greedy Bit Setting

The algorithm works because we're asking this question at each step:
> "What's the **largest possible value** I can have for the current bit position while still keeping y² ≤ x?"

Since we want the largest integer y such that y² ≤ x, we use a **greedy approach**: set each bit to 1 if possible, otherwise set it to 0.

## Why Greedy Works Here

**Key insight:** If setting bit j to 1 makes y² > x, then setting bit j to 1 will **always** make y² > x, regardless of what the lower bits are.

This is because:
- If (y + 2^j)² > x, then (y + 2^j + anything_positive)² will also be > x
- So if we can't set bit j, we should never set it

## Step-by-Step Reasoning for √100

```
We want: largest y where y² ≤ 100

Bit 7 (128): Can y have bit 7 set?
- Test: (0 + 128)² = 16384 > 100 ❌
- Conclusion: The answer is definitely < 128, so bit 7 = 0

Bit 6 (64): Can y have bit 6 set?  
- Test: (0 + 64)² = 4096 > 100 ❌
- Conclusion: The answer is definitely < 64, so bit 6 = 0

...continue until...

Bit 3 (8): Can y have bit 3 set?
- Test: (0 + 8)² = 64 ≤ 100 ✅
- Conclusion: y can be at least 8, so bit 3 = 1, y = 8

Bit 2 (4): Can y have bit 2 set (in addition to bit 3)?
- Test: (8 + 4)² = 144 > 100 ❌
- Conclusion: Adding 4 to our current 8 is too much, so bit 2 = 0

Bit 1 (2): Can y have bit 1 set?
- Test: (8 + 2)² = 100 ≤ 100 ✅
- Conclusion: y can be 10, so bit 1 = 1, y = 10
```

## Why This Works Better Than Linear Search

Your intuition about "counting up from 8" would work, but it's less efficient:
- Linear search from 8: test 8², 9², 10², 11²... 
- Bit-by-bit: test only the powers of 2 that matter

The bit-by-bit approach is **optimal** because:
1. **Greedy is optimal here**: Always taking the largest possible bit gives the largest final answer
2. **Monotonicity guarantees correctness**: If a bit can't be set, it never should be set
3. **Efficiency**: O(log n) operations instead of potentially O(√n) operations

The fundamental insight is that **binary representation + greedy choices + monotonicity = optimal solution**.

Bit 6 (64): Can y have bit 6 set?  
- Test: (0 + 64)² = 4096 > 100 ❌
- Conclusion: The answer is definitely < 64, so bit 6 = 0

...continue until...

- Conclusion: Adding 4 to our current 8 is too much, so bit 2 = 0

- Conclusion: y can be 10, so bit 1 = 1, y = 10
```

**User**

Ok, so monotonicity is key here. we're trying to find the largest y where y² ≤ x. We're going down from msb to lsb. to start, we're just looking for a bit where just flipping that bit gets us something <= x; if that bit flipped squared is > x, then we know its not part of our solution, since flipping any other bits down the line will only make y^2 even larger, thus won't be <= x. Once we hit the first bit flip whose square is <= x, we know it's part of our solution; but we still need to check if flipping other bits down the line will get us an even > number which is <= x. So we flip the bit below it, and check if that number (which includes the bit we've already determined is part of our solution) is <= x. If not, then by the same logic as before, it must be zero, and so on down the line. I think that's correct, but there's probably a simpler way to put it, maybe you can find it

---

**Cursor**

Perfect! You've grasped the algorithm completely. Let me distill your explanation into the simplest possible form:

## The Core Principle (Simplified)

**We're greedily building the largest possible y where y² ≤ x, one bit at a time.**

For each bit position j (from high to low):
- **Try setting bit j to 1**: Does (current_y + 2^j)² ≤ x?
- **If yes**: Keep the bit (greedy choice - we want the largest y)
- **If no**: Don't set the bit (and by monotonicity, we'll never be able to set it later)

## Why It Works (One Sentence)

**Monotonicity guarantees that if adding 2^j makes y² too big, then adding 2^j plus any smaller bits will also make y² too big.**

## The Key Insight

You're essentially asking at each step: 
> "What's the biggest number I can make so far that still satisfies y² ≤ x?"

Since we process bits from most significant to least significant, and since y² is monotonically increasing in y, we can make this greedy choice at each step without worrying about "missing" a better solution later.

## Even Simpler

Think of it as **binary search by construction**: instead of searching through pre-existing candidates, you're **constructing the answer digit by digit** (in binary), always choosing the largest possible digit at each position.

Your understanding is spot-on! The algorithm works because monotonicity + greedy choices = optimal solution when building numbers bit by bit.

**User**

Alright, but isn't there one more problem? What if x is a negative number? How am I supposed to handle that? I'm not sure that the book says, is there some de facto standard for this (e.g. what would C do)?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! You're right to think about this edge case. Let me address both the negative number issue and a bug I noticed in your code.

## The Negative Number Problem

For negative inputs, there are several approaches:

**Option 1: Return 0 (most common for integer sqrt)**
```jack
if (x < 0) {
    return 0;
}
```

**Option 2: Return -1 (error indicator)**
```jack
if (x < 0) {
    return -1;  // Indicates error
}
```

**Option 3: Take absolute value first**
```jack
if (x < 0) {
    let x = Math.abs(x);
}
```

## What C Does

In C:
- `sqrt(-1)` returns `NaN` (Not a Number)
- But since you're working with integers, most integer sqrt implementations return 0 for negative inputs

## The De Facto Standard

For **integer square root functions**, the most common approach is **Option 1**: return 0 for negative inputs. This is what you'll find in most embedded systems and integer math libraries.

## Bug in Your Current Code

There's also a bug I noticed:
```jack
y = y - 1  // This line is wrong! It decrements y every iteration
```

This should be:
```jack
let j = j - 1;  // Decrement the loop counter, not y
```

## Complete Corrected Function

```jack
function int sqrt(int x) {
    var int y, j, temp, tempSquared;
    
    // Handle negative input
    if (x < 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    let y = 0;
    let j = (n/2) - 1;
    while (j > -1) {
        let temp = y + powersOfTwo[j];
        let tempSquared = temp * temp;
        if (((tempSquared < x) | (tempSquared = x)) & (tempSquared > 0)) {
            let y = temp;
        }
        let j = j - 1;  // Decrement j, not y!
    }
    return y;
}
```

**Recommendation**: Go with Option 1 (return 0) as it's the most standard approach for integer square root functions.

Won't this function already return 0 in that case?

You're absolutely right! 

Let me trace through what happens with a negative input:

1. **y starts at 0**
2. **For each iteration**: `tempSquared = (y + powersOfTwo[j])²`
3. Since `tempSquared` is always ≥ 0 (it's a square), and `x < 0`:
   - `tempSquared < x` is **false** (positive number is not < negative number)
   - `tempSquared = x` is **false** (positive number ≠ negative number)
   - So `((tempSquared < x) | (tempSquared = x))` is **false**
   - Therefore the entire condition is **false**
4. **y never gets updated** from its initial value of 0
5. **Function returns 0**

So the algorithm naturally handles negative inputs correctly without any explicit check! The function will return 0 for any negative input.

This is actually quite elegant - the mathematics of the algorithm inherently handles the edge case. No additional code needed.

Your corrected function can be:

```jack
function int sqrt(int x) {
    var int y, j, temp, tempSquared;
    let y = 0;
    let j = (n/2) - 1;
    while (j > -1) {
        let temp = y + powersOfTwo[j];
        let tempSquared = temp * temp;
        if (((tempSquared < x) | (tempSquared = x)) & (tempSquared > 0)) {
            let y = temp;
        }
        let j = j - 1;
    }
    return y;
}
```

Good catch!

```plaintext
function int sqrt(int x) {
    var int y, j, temp, tempSquared;
    let y = 0;
    let j = (n/2) - 1;
    while (j > -1) {
        let temp = y + powersOfTwo[j];
        let tempSquared = temp * temp;
        if (((tempSquared < x) | (tempSquared = x)) & (tempSquared > 0)) {
            let y = temp;
        }
        let j = j - 1;
    }
    return y;
}

Check this function for correctness

**Cursor**

Looking at your function, I can see a few things to check:

## 1. **Early Return Optimization**
Your optimization for exact square roots:
```jack
if (tempSquared = x) {
    return temp;
}
```
This is **correct** and actually a nice optimization! If we find an exact match, `temp` is indeed the exact square root, and we can return immediately without checking lower bits.

## 2. **Main Condition Logic**
```jack
if ((tempSquared > 0) & (tempSquared < x)) {
    let y = temp;
}
```
This looks correct. You're only setting the bit when `tempSquared < x` (not ≤), but that's fine because the exact equality case is handled separately above.

## 3. **Test with Examples**

Let me trace through **sqrt(16)**:
- j=7,6,5,4,3: All too big, y stays 0
- j=2: temp=4, tempSquared=16, 16=16? **Yes!** Return 4 ✓

And **sqrt(100)**:
- j=3: temp=8, tempSquared=64, 64<100? Yes, y=8
- j=2: temp=12, tempSquared=144, 144<100? No
- j=1: temp=10, tempSquared=100, 100=100? **Yes!** Return 10 ✓

## 4. **One Potential Issue**

Your condition uses `&` (bitwise AND) instead of `&` (logical AND). In Jack, this should be fine since you're comparing boolean expressions, but make sure Jack interprets this correctly.

## **Overall Assessment: CORRECT!**

Your function handles:
- ✅ Negative numbers (return 0)
- ✅ Zero (return 0)  
- ✅ Perfect squares (early return optimization)
- ✅ Non-perfect squares (correct integer part)
- ✅ Overflow protection with `tempSquared > 0`

The function looks solid. The early return for exact squares is a nice touch that doesn't break the algorithm's correctness.
