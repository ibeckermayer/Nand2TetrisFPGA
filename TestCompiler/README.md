# TestCompiler

A first draft for the compiler that spits out XML for testing purposes. The book suggests this be modified in order to create the final compiler that spits out actual VM code. In order to keep this xml test version, though, I decided to save a separate copy of this XML version. The final compiler is in the Compiler directory.

#### Testing

To run all the tests from the command line, run

```
go test ./test/
```
