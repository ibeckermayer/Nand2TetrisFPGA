# Nand2TetrisFPGA

This project is an FPGA implementation of the Hack computer architecture described in the book [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), By Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.

Hardware components are described in Verilog and can be found in the `Hack` directory.

The assembler is written in C (because I wanted to brush up on my C skills) and is located in the `Assembler` directory.
